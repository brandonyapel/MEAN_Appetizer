Thank you to Prime Digital Academy for teaching me how to code in their Full Stack Engineering Bootcamp.  I dreamed up this project for my Individual/Thesis Project for the Bootcamp.  I intend to continue my developing this app and making it available to assist students of Prime to fullfill their dreams of creating full stack apps.
